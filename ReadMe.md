This project is building for displaying the data saved in Excel on a webpage<br>
Without relying on databases such as MySQL<br><br>
It achieves by dynamically monitoring changes to the Excel file, so any updates made to the file will be automatically reflected in the data displayed on the webpage<br><br>
Additionally the project is fully able to use camera to scan the Barcode and transform it to a string for searching.<br><br>
